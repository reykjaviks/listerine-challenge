    <h2>QUEEN'S CORGI TURNS INTO HAMSTER</h2>
    <p>
        The Muggles were left scratching their heads today as their Queen's corgi changed into a hamster. <strong>Luckily</strong> 
        enough for us they just thought that the corgi had been stolen and a hamster put in it's place as a cruel joke. 
        There if now a full scale hunt on for the real corgi which of course will not be found. The Ministry of Magic are 
        looking into this matter. The Improper Use of Magic Office have a few suspect they are questioning about the incident. 
        A motive for the attack if not known but further attacks on public Muggle figures would not help us one bit. 
        The International Federation of Warlocks is also meeting to discuss the incident. The Daily Prophet will keep 
        you up to date on further news on that story tomorrow.

    <h2>OUR CHASERS AREN'T CHEATING!</h2>
    <p>
      That was the stunned reaction of Quidditch fans across Britain last night when the so-called "Stooging Penalty"
      was announced by the Department of Magical Games and Sports last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instances of stooging have been on the increase," said a harassed-looking Departmental representative last
      night.
      "We feel that this new rule will eliminate the severe Keeper injuries we have been seeing only too often. From now
      on,
      one Chaser will attempt to beat the Keeper, as opposed to three Chasers beating the Keeper up. Everything will be
      much
      cleaner and fairer."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Departmental representative was forced to retreat as the angry crowd started to bombard him
      with
      Quaffles. Wizards from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement arrived to disperse the crowd, who were
      threatening
      to stooge the Minister of Magic himself.
    </p>
    <p>One freckle-faced six-year-old left the hall in tears.</p>
    <p>
      "I loved stooging," he sobbed to the Daily Prophet. "Me and me dad like watching them Keepers flattened. I don't
      want to go to Quidditch no more."

                    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It
                    eluded
                    us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther . . . And
                    one
                    fine morning —
                    <br>
                    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

                The Great Gatsby is a lyrical rendering of Fitzgerald's own perception of the paradox of wealth.
                It gives one power and privilege but it blunts sensitivities and moral awareness and erodes goodness.

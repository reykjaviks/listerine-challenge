        <h1>The Paradoxical Commandments</h1>
        <div class="commandments">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
                    <br>Do good anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
                    <br>Love them anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
                    <br>Succeed anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
                    <br>Do good anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with
                    the smallest minds.
                    <br>Think big anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
                    <br>Fight for a few underdogs anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
                    <br>Build anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
                    <br>Be honest and frank anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.
                    <br>Help people anyway.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. </li>
            <li>I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare.</li>
            <li>I hate your big, dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind. </li>
            <li>I hate you so much it makes me sick — It even makes me rhyme. </li>
            <li>I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. </li>
            <li>I hate it when you make me laugh — Even worse when you make me cry.</li>
            <li>I hate it when you're not around. And the fact that you didn't call.</li>
            <li>But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you — Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.</li>
        </ul>
